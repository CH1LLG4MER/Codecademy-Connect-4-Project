# Codecademy Connect 4 Project
This is my first attempt at making a Connect 4 game for my Codecademy Portfolio Project. My version of Connect 4 will be played using the command line interface, have multiple songs that can be played when a match starts, allow players to input the name they want, and choose to continue or end the match. It's not much, but I did my best to make the game I loved playing as a kid.
